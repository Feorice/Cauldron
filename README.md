Cauldron W.I.P.
========

This is an editor for an orthogonal 3D voxel based game.

About 99% of the work is unfinished and most code will be re-done.
Most of the code comes from working examples that I have put together to produce the current state.

Too many sources to keep track of, but thanks to all of those who were happy enough to share their wisdom on the Internet.

Current capabilities include being able to snap the camera to an orthogonal view or move the camera freely.
As it stands, this editor only loads one 16x16x16 block, which comprises of 4,096 smaller blocks that are 2x2x2 pixels in size.
The block should be 32x32x32 pixels in size all together.
